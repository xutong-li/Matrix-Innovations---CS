We’re gonna be using open HEP3 access into the building out the best chop bar in the world. Our goal is to rival IBM’s Watson, Alexa and the Siri’s of the world however, in order to do that we need to be able to create a door edge motor. To do this we need to be able to organize the user in different buckets by attributes such as wealth, age, job, single, married etc. Other factors can come into play such as credit, assets, liabilities, equity, and many more. For this week’s task students have been put together into a group and will create an open source code via open air, credentials will be provided via our discord chat.

We are going to be able to create an AI chat bot which alo of the leg work has been done for however, we want to assess how well each group would classify users and be able to use predictive analysis. An example would be a user traveling to school and spending $50 a week at LCBO. Certain questions that can be asked is does he have investments, what is his parents income, what their credit is and etc. We can give him recommendations based on the provided information e.g., we can give suggestions such as being able to invest in stocks. The information that we get is going to be imperative to be analyzed.
